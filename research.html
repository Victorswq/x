    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Modeling user sequential behaviors has recently attracted increasing attention in the recommendation domain. Existing methods
mostly assume coherent preference in the same sequence. However,
user personalities are volatile and easily changed, and there can
be multiple mixed preferences underlying user behaviors. To solve
this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel sequential recommender model via decomposing and modeling user independent
preferences. To achieve this goal, we highlight three practical challenges considering the inconsistent, evolving and uneven nature of
the user behaviors. For overcoming these challenges in a unified
framework, we introduce a reinforcement learning module to simulate the evolution of user preference. More specifically, the action
aims to allocate each item into a sub-sequence or create a new one
according to how the previous items are decomposed as well as the
time interval between successive behaviors. The reward is associated with the final loss of the learning objective, aiming to generate
sub-sequences which can better fit the training data. We conduct
extensive experiments based on eight real-world datasets across
different domains. Comparing with the state-of-the-art methods,
empirical studies manifest that our model can on average improve
the performance by about 9.68%, 12.4%, 8.56% and 7.13% on the
metrics of Precision, Recall, NDCG and MRR, respectively. </p></div>

    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> With the ever prospering of the web technologies, there is a common need to make recommendations from
heterogeneous sources, such as recommending products and
advertisements together on the e-commerce websites. People
usually solve such recommendation problem by a two-stage
paradigm, where the first stage is generating candidates from
each source, and the second one is aggregating and ranking
the generated heterogeneous candidates to produce the final
results. While existing models have achieved many successes, they
mostly optimize the above two stages separately, where the user
preferences can only be used to supervise the second stage, while
for the first one, there is no signal to tell whether the generated
candidates are accurate enough to cover the user preference. To
solve the above problem, in this paper, we design a multi-agent
framework to jointly optimize the above two stages. In specific,
suppose there are N sources in our problem, then we deploy N+1
agents, where the first N agents correspond one-to-one with the
sources, aiming to select the sources-specific candidates, and the
last agent is designed to aggregate the candidates from different
sources for the final recommendation. All the agents play a
cooperative game, aiming to maximize the rewards revealing
user preferences. We implement our idea based on the Deep Qnetwork, where we design a decomposable reward to enhance
the training efficiency. We adapt our model to a real-world
recommendation problem abstracted from a famous short video
platform–Kuaishou.com. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. </p></div>

    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Debiased recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both industry and academic communities. Traditional models mostly rely on the inverse propensity score (IPS), which can be hard to estimate
and may suffer from the high variance issue. To alleviate these problems, in this article, we propose a novel
debiased recommendation framework based on user feature balancing. The general idea is to introduce a
projection function to adjust user feature distributions, such that the ideal unbiased learning objective can be
upper bounded by a solvable objective purely based on the offline dataset. In the upper bound, the projected
user distributions are expected to be equal given different items. From the causal inference perspective, this
requirement aims to remove the causal relation from the user to the item, which enables us to achieve unbiased recommendation, bypassing the computation of IPS. To efficiently balance the user distributions upon
each item pair, we propose three strategies, including clipping, sampling, and adversarial learning to improve
the training process. For more robust optimization, we deploy an explicit model to capture the potential latent confounders in recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first work on
debiased recommendation based on confounder balancing. In the experiments, we compare our framework
with many state-of-the-art methods based on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model is effective in promoting the recommendation performance. </p></div>

    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Explainable recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both academic and industry communities. Among
different explainable strategies, generating natural language explanations is an important method, which can deliver more informative, flexible and readable explanations to facilitate better user
decisions. Despite the effectiveness, existing models are mostly
optimized based on the observed datasets, which can be skewed
due to the selection or exposure bias. To alleviate this problem, in
this paper, we formulate the task of explainable recommendation
with a causal graph, and design a causality enhanced framework to
generate unbiased explanations. More specifically, we firstly define
an ideal unbiased learning objective, and then derive a tractable
loss for the observational data based on the inverse propensity
score (IPS), where the key is a sample re-weighting strategy for
equalizing the loss and ideal objective in expectation. Considering
that the IPS estimated from the sparse and noisy recommendation
datasets can be inaccurate, we introduce a fault tolerant mechanism
by minimizing the maximum loss induced by the sample weights
near the IPS. For more comprehensive modeling, we further analyze
and infer the potential latent confounders induced by the complex
and diverse user personalities. We conduct extensive experiments
by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods based on three
real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In the U.S. and other developed countries, obesity rates have risen despite stabilized caloric intake and increased physical activity, challenging the traditional energy balance model. This proposal introduces a metabolic-centric model, grounded in recent biochemistry advances, to explain this paradox. It posits that metabolic disruptions, driven by factors such as increased levels of Omega-6 fatty acids in the food supply, environmental contaminants, or microbiome changes, are key. I critically review data sources and empirical evidence supporting these channels. Furthermore, I outline how economists, with their unique perspectives on incentives and tradeoffs, can contribute to innovative solutions for the obesity epidemic. </p></div><br>
